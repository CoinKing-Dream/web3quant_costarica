              Each Asset class has its own rhythm and volatility profile. Hence
              there are different models for each such as Crypto, TradFi, and

              All my models are based on the same timeless principles but how I

            The past performance looks too good to be true. If you were that
            good you would be managing money for a hedge fund. Just tell us how

              A lot of people have this idea that for a trader to be legit and
              successful, they need to be managing money. But nothing can be far
              from the truth.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Managing money requires spending the bulk of the time in admin
              work, managing clients and their emotions, and lots of unnecessary
              calls and meetings.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              A lot of red tape and bureaucracy too. A fund manager is never
              truly free to just focus on Trading and Strategy alone.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Also, there can never be one fund that can cover different
              categories of investors across the globe. It requires multiple
              setups, strategies, a bigger team, security & backend
              infrastructure, and most likely a corporate kind of setup.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Although it makes a lot more money for the fund manager and looks
              great from an outsider's perspective, It's really NOT for
              everyone.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              In the creator economy, there are other ways to do things and
              hence I chose a subscription model over managing money.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              As far as performance is concerned. All posts since inception are

            Why High Time Frame (HTF)? Why not Lower the Time Frame (LTF)? The

          <div className="general-text">
            <div className="leading-normal">
              It depends if you are after Fast Money or Big Money.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              The model is designed for the latter and focuses on wealth
              creation.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              It does so by going after only explosive trends and momentum. This
              results in strong moves that you often see.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              It's not a coincidence that model picks do 50%-100% and sometimes
              multiple X returns just days after it goes Long.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              In the last bull cycle Model was able to catch 100x moves in
              Matic,Sol, Axie and Many 10x-50x moves in other coins.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              During their up move, NOT some but ALL of these coins had mid-week
              sharp pullbacks in the range of 30%-40% before continuing upwards.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              NO lower time-frame quant model would've stayed long in such cases
              and would've missed out on those mega winners.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Lastly, HTF allows you to build positions, scale in and out, and
              not be glued to your monitor 24/7.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              The ROI on time spent is priceless. Most LTF traders burn out

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Although the Model generates superlative returns, it's designed to
              prioritize RISK Management over everything else.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              There are predefined invalidation levels for every Long position.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Additionally, there is a regime filter built into the model which
              detects if it's a bull phase or a bear phase.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              During the bear phase, the model automatically gets into Capital
              preservation mode, exits all positions, and gets into 100% Cash.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              It plays both OFFENSE and DEFENSE.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              The model by design does NOT catch the tops, bottoms, or
              reversals. It's only designed to catch the meat of the move in
              both directions.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              It goes long after the uptrend is established and by that time the
              asset is usually up 10-20% from the lows.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Also when the trend breaks and it exits, assets are usually down
              10-20% from the highs.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Then there are whipsaws to deal with, which means after you exit,
              the very next week the model could go long again and vice versa.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Model is designed to tolerate volatility but humans are not.

            So How does the Model handle the Black Swan event?
          </div>
          <div className="general-text">
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Firstly, it's fashionable nowadays to call every correction a
              black swan. Black Swans by definition are extremely rare.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              The 2008 Crisis or LUNA crash was NOT a Black Swan. Many people
              saw it coming from a mile away.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Strictly from a trading/investing perspective, even COVID was not
              a Black Swan. News of the Virus came out somewhere in Jan 2020 and
              Markets crashed in Feb End.

            <div className="leading-normal">Model Exited LUNA in the $80s.</div>
            <div className="leading-normal">

              crash.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Both are on the performance page.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Just because something corrects a lot doesn't make it a black
              swan. It's when NOONE sees it coming, even the smart money.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Most of the time, smart money already knows that Sh*t is about to
              hit the fan, they exit and the footprint is easy to track.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              FTX was truly a black swan where even the smart money was
              blindsided and everything crashed and burned within 48 hours from
              the time it came out.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Even during such an extreme scenario, the Model was able to exit
              SOLANA which was one of the closest coins to FTX, before it
              crashed by 65%.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Models sell call is publicly recorded and can be verified.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              For true black swan scenarios, there's a disaster stop-loss built
              in.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              If the model detects huge selling beyond a certain threshold
              level, across the board in ALL of its longs with high volumes then
              it Exits All positions.

          <div className="medium-title">So you follow the model yourself?</div>
          <div className="general-text">
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Yes. HTF Model is my go-to system.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Additionally, I have developed LTF models. I use them in

          <div className="medium-title">
            You always talk about LONG only and being in CASH. Is the model not

            <div className="leading-normal">
              Model has the capability but they are not published.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              The reason is that most, even those who consider themselves pro
              traders do not have the sophistication to Short and Make money.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              AShorting makes great headlines but risk-reward is always better
              in going long.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Especially in a hyper-growth space like Crypto where the upside is
              multiple Xs whereas even if you get the shorts perfectly right you
              make 30-40% at best. coz no one shorts all the way to 0.
            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Historically even the greatest short sellers of all time have made

            </div>
            <div className="leading-normal">
              Lastly, long only is hassle-free to implement, as one can build
              spot positions without leverage and ride out the volatility with
              ease.
