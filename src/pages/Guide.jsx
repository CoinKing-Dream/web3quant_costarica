              100s of studies have shown that the majority of hedge funds or
              managers with all their fancy intellect and $$ cannot even beat a

            <div className="leading-normal">

              For the majority of the population, that's the right answer. They

            <div className="leading-normal">
              But Buy & Hold works best for indices and not individual names.
              Coz indices take care of the churn and are not visible to the
              investor. S&P500 now vs what it was a decade ago is very
              different.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              The only downside of Buy & Hold is, what you choose to buy and
              hold determines EVERYTHING.

              Holding the wrong thing which most often is the case, ruins all

                    Markets typically trend 30% of the time and range 70% of the

                    If the model is designed well, the chops will be minimal but
                    there is NO way to avoid them completely. It's not a bug,

                    Occasionally you will be right and the model will be wrong
                    too. Yet you need to follow it. It takes a discipline of a
                    monk to trust some model and not yourself especially when
                    you have money on the line and it's not for everyone.

                    very likely you will be quit midway and the model will go on

                A lot of people pay a lot $$$$ to learn this one thing in paid
                courses so pay close attention. If you internalize Risk reward
                instead of Win Rate it will change how you trade.

              <div className="leading-normal">
                Most amateurs think you need to be right all the time to make
                money in the markets. All they focus on is the win rate. But
                here's a fun fact
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                Many of the world's most successful trading models and traders
                have a win rate of 30%-40%. Despite getting 6 of 10 wrong, they
                are wildly profitable. How?
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                They optimize for risk-reward (RR) which means how much would
                you lose vs how much would you win on a particular trade.
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                For example, If a trading model has a RR of 1:3 which means
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                If you lose the trade, you lose 1% of your capital.
                <br />
                If you win the trade, you gain 3% of your capital.
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                If you achieve a win rate of 40% or higher, the trading model
                would be profitable.
              </div>
              <div className="leading-normal">
                And if your win rate is higher then the profitability of the
                model goes exponentially higher with that RR, as the effect of
                compounding kicks in.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              HTF is used for signaling. And LTF is used for scaling in & out of

              <span className="medium-title">Fixed Dollar Amount Sizing</span>-
              With this technique, you determine a fixed dollar amount to
              allocate to each trade. For example, you may decide to risk $500
              on each trade regardless of the stock price or volatility. While
              it's simple to implement and good for beginners it does not
              automatically scale up or down with the account size.

            <div className="leading-normal">
              <span className="medium-title">Volatility-Based Sizing </span>- In
              this method you allocate a higher % of the capital to majors such
              as BTC/ETH high market cap coins and a lower % of capital to high
              volatility low market cap Alts.

              <span className="medium-title">Fixed Percentage of Capital </span>
              - In this technique, you allocate a fixed percentage of your
              trading capital to each trade. For instance, you might decide to
              risk 2% of your capital on each trade. As your capital fluctuates,
              the position size adjusts accordingly. Among the 3, this approach
              helps maintain consistent risk across trades and hence is the most
              optimal.

              The additional position should be smaller than your initial
              position to manage risk. The idea is to add to your position
              selectively as the trade moves in your favor.

              With each new position added, adjust your stop loss level to
              protect the accumulated profits. This helps ensure that even if

              previous positions.
